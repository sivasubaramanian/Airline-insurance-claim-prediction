# Airline insurance claim prediction using Machine learning
Abstract 

Now a day's Data is playing a central role and is carrying the big asset in the insurance industry. 
In today's journey insurance industry has a vital role. Insurance transporters have access to more 
information than ever before. From the past 700+ years in the insurance industry we can consider 
the three major eras Starting from 15th century to 1960, industry followed the manual era, 
from1960s to 2000 we are in the systems era, now we are in digital era i.e. 2001-20X0.The 
highest corporate object in all three eras is that the fundamental insurance industry has been 
determined by believing the data analytics in adopting the changing technologies to better and 
keep the ways and keep capital together. In advanced analysis the main challenge is the 
analytical models and algorithms which are being insufficient to support insurers; only by 
machines we can overcome this challenge. This study suggests using decision tree, support 
vector machine, kernel approx, random forest classifier and lasso regression as data mining 
techniques and classification algorithms to predict the airlines insurance claim.
Keywords: Machine Learning, Digital Era, Client Lifetime Value (CLV).
